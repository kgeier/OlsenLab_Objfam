# OlsenLab_ObjectFamiliarity
All code used or pertaining to the eye-tracking portion of the study called Object Familiarity (Objfam) in Dr. Rosanna Olsen's lab at the University of Toronto. 

#Main notes:
-Some scripts have a few parts that were done manually or use the same variable names for two different analysis so should be run in parts. The scripts have been written with different purposes in mind over the course of 2 years, so there may be vestigal bits of code that make legibility really poor (but I don't want to get rid of as I'd be trying to fix what isn't broken). 
-Some code is for preparing eye-tracking data to be in a few formats analyzable by classic machine learning methods. Machine learning is not particularly good at classifying this type of data (low effect sizes and high variability). These analysis were not included in the paper.
